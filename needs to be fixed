like buttons needs to be clicked twice before incrementing likes
find a way to make them increment likes without having to change from thumbs up back to thumbs down
if a like by default is thumbs up on click it should increment likes 
by default the like button should stay at thumbs up 
the like button should go to thumbs down only when it is clicked by the authenticated user but should display all counts from other users
